# calculator
basic calc using javascript

This is my solution for the calculator challenge. This was a lot harder than I thought it would be as I have only been studying web dev for roughly 6 weeks and I
am very much a beginner when it comes to Javascript. Spend 2 hours trying different ways of checking for a checked radio button before realising the incredibly simple 
solution using an event listener for a click. 

This challenge was very helpful and I feel i have made some progress within JavaScript for the first time as this is my first project with a notable amound of JS included.
Also, I am happy with including try/catch for if the user attempts to use an invalid expression. 

If I was to redo this challenge I would make this app resposive to mobile at the start instead of waiting until completion to convert it with media queries as I would have
neede to change this on all 3 stylesheets. 

Thank you!
